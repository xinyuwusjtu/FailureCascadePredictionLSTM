# FailureCascadePredictionLSTM

These two python codes are for doing failure cascade sequence training and prediction by LSTM. It can predict both the final state, and the specific time that each link may fail. 
The file 'CascadeDataProcess.py' is to process the data in a proper form, while 'CascadeTrainingAndPrediction.py' is for training, testing, and performance evaluation.
